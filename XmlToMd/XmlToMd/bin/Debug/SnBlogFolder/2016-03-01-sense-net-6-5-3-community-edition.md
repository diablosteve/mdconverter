## Speedup: indexing and security activities

This is a huge improvement for projects where there are many activities happening in the Content Repository at the same time: in previous versions the indexing subsystem handled all operations in a single queue, making completely independent operations wait for each other. This is not the case anymore: our improved activity queue is able to execute independent activities in a parallel way so that users will get a faster response.

## Customizable content naming

Finally, developers get the chance to customize the behaviour of the system when a content name must be generated (e.g. from the display name or when you upload a document). We offer two built-in [content naming providers](http://wiki.sensenet.com/ContentNamingProvider>) for you to choose from, but of course you can develop your own too.

## Login through OData

This is a first step toward a more open content repository: now it is possible to log in to the portal through our [OData REST API](http://wiki.sensenet.com/OData_REST_API>). This is useful for custom mobile applications or 3rd party portals that want to access the Content Repository using [cross-origin ajax calls](http://wiki.sensenet.com/Cross-origin_resource_sharing>).
